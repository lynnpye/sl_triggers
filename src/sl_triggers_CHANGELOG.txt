    enhancement: dynamic command library lookup
        this is going to be geared more toward extension authors but essentially this will make it TONS easier to add functions you can call in your scripts

108
    enhancement: added sl_triggersAPI for other mod authors to access SLT features
        sl_triggersAPI exposes the following endpoints:
            GetVersion()
            GetScriptsList()
            RunScript(string _scriptname, Actor _actor = none) ; defaults to Player
                if RunScript() is called without an Actor provided
                    it will first try the Actor currently in your crosshairs if there is one
                    it will fall back to the Player

    enhancement: added console commands (slt/sl_triggers)
        slt console command has the following usage:
			Usage: slt version          ; displays sl_triggers mod version
			Usage: slt list             ; lists the scripts available to run from SLT
			Usage: slt run <scriptname> ; where <scriptname> is a valid script for SLT
                when slt run is called
                    it will first check if there is an Actor currently selected in the console
                    it will then check for an Actor in the crosshairs
                    it will fall back to the Player

107
    enhancement: new commands for your scripts:
            dd_unlockslot <slot#> <"force" (optional)> ; slot# i.e. 32 is body ; if "force" is added as a second parameter, it will also unlock quest items
            dd_unlockall <"force" (optional)> ; works like dd_unlockslot but for all slots
        Note that after unlocking items may still appear to be equipped in inventory but you should be able to safely select and remove them
        And a script to demonstrate
            DD Unlock All.ini
    enhancement: .ini scripts now support comment to end of line
        sl_isin $self ; this is a valid comment
        ; as would be this (all by itself)
    

106
    enhancement: flagged as .ESL
    bugfix: workaround for Papyrus VM string case destruction
    enhancement: added Devious Followers Redux commands
            df_setdebt
            df_resetall
        additionally, I also added scripts:
            DF Set Debt to 0.ini
            DF Reset All.ini

105
    bugfix: possible resolution issue with global variables in some cases
    enhancement: new feature, subroutines
        beginsub <subroutinename>/endsub to demarcate the subroutine
        gosub <subroutinename> to execute and return
    enhancement: new feature, "call"
        call <command file name> <optional $1 argument> <optional $2 argument> ...
            stops execution of current command file, runs the requested file, then resumes current command file
            if an extension is not specified .ini is tried first, then .json
            variable scopes are NOT shared (global variables are, of course, still global)
                so if you set $1, then call a function, it will not see your $1 value
                but if you use $g1, it will
            arguments are passed by value
        callarg <index> <variable name>
            Example: callarg 0 $2
            this will place the first (index 0) argument passed into $2
            

104
    multiple bugfixes related to MCM and settings management
    new file layout under the hood

103
    bugfix: trigger primes were not dispelling themselves at end of service
    bugfix: result stacks were not crossing back from extensions to core

102
    bugfix: fixed problem where available triggers would not reset between launches of the game
    bugfix: fixed problem with MCM OID handling (might not have noticed it; it could be subtle)
    enhancement: QoL for your developer; lots of code clean up and trying to fix problems I introduced due to code clean up
        .. like, a LOT of code cleanup. Refactoring. Removing comments. Adding comments.
    enhancement: Added localization. sl_triggers doesn't have much to translate, but if you want to donate translations I'll add them

101
    bugfix: sexlab compat
    enhancement: sl_orgasm

100
    beta: the new hotness is all about modularity... I really need to write this up

21
	bugfix: position is now being handled correctly by the MCM (it was overwriting the "role" attribute)

20
	bugfix: Chance works again

19
	enhancement: new operation
		- sl_isinslot - is the specified actor in the specified slot of a SexLab scene (I accidentally implemented this and kept it)
			["sl_isinslot", "$self", "1"]
				$$ == "1" if true; "0" otherwise
	enhancement: new trigger criteria: is_position (is the actor in the indicated slot; what I was asked for)
	enhancement: setting events back to "Select an Event" clears out the event, helping keep your settings.json cleaner
	bugfix: Main no longer skipping most of the checks due to my switch to int conversion and not paying attention to !
	bugfix: SexLab event handling no longer goes into an infinite loop (present since v16)
	change: brought in "whatsnew" to consolidate change history

18
	enhancement: new operations
		- sl_advance
			["sl_advance"] (go forward) OR ["sl_advance", "-1"] (go backward)
		- actor_isaffectedby
			["actor_isaffectedby", "Skyrim.esm:1030541"] (actor is affected by FortifyHealthFFSelf (i.e. Potion of Health), $$ == "1")

17
	enhancement: removed SexLab hard dependency; you can now enjoy your sl(shhh)_triggers on your more vanilla Skyrim experiences
		existing functions should gracefully degrade or give best accurate answer (i.e. gender coming from base actor instead of sexlab if not available)
	enhancement: MCM Main page now displays SexLab status
	bugfix: fixed a bug in the MCM trigger cleanup code

16
	enhancement: added keymapping as an event; you can now bind keymappings to, as usual, up to 3 command files
		also allows for modifier use
		also allows for Dynamic Activation Key use per trigger
	enhancement: events will only be registered for if triggers exist that use them; if you do not hook any SexLab events, they will not be registered
		registration will update if you update the MCM
	change: lots of refactoring, technically some performance improvements but I haven't done timings so it's mostly my instinct, some general code cleanup (mostly due to mess of my own making)
	change: event id values (0 for SLStart...) are now 1 higher (1 for SLStart) to make the MCM behave more nicely; this should get converted automatically
	change: started adding some non-trigger values into settings.json, currently to track version; this is to help allow for settings updates in the future
	

15
	enhancement: improved "top of the hour" updategametime processing
	enhancement: variables can be any "$<non-negative-int>"
		["set", "$42", "life, the universe, and everything"]
		is now valid
	enhancement: global variables can be any "$g<non-negative-int>"
		["set", "$g42", "life, the universe, and everything"]
		is now valid
	fixed bug: fixed race condition when running multiple commands from one trigger
	change: renamed operation "actual_hours_since_last_top" to "toh_elapsed_time"
		"actual_hours_since_last_top" redirects to the new functionality for now
	

14
	split "if_race" into "if_race" and "if_player"
		you will likely need to update any triggers that relied on "if_race" previously
		existing "if_race" values will not be automatically updated and you will probably see:
			if you had...			then you will now have until you edit it...
			Player					Undead
			Not Player				Partner Humanoid
			Undead					Partner Creature
			Partner Humanoid		Partner Undead
			Partner Creature		??
			Partner Player			.. crabs??
			Partner Not Player		.. the void of space??
			Partner Undead			Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.

			Any
			Humanoid

			Partner Creature
			Partner Undead
			
		"if_player" offers:
			Any

			Not Player

13
	added event handling for "top of the hour" (i.e. on the 'o'clock for each in-game hour, with the player as $self)

	added new operations:
