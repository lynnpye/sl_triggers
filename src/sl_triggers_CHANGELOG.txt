    bugfix: trigger primes were not dispelling themselves at end of service

102
    bugfix: fixed problem where available triggers would not reset between launches of the game
    bugfix: fixed problem with MCM OID handling (might not have noticed it; it could be subtle)
    enhancement: QoL for your developer; lots of code clean up and trying to fix problems I introduced due to code clean up
        .. like, a LOT of code cleanup. Refactoring. Removing comments. Adding comments.
    enhancement: Added localization. sl_triggers doesn't have much to translate, but if you want to donate translations I'll add them

101
    bugfix: sexlab compat
    enhancement: sl_orgasm

100
    beta: the new hotness is all about modularity... I really need to write this up

21
	bugfix: position is now being handled correctly by the MCM (it was overwriting the "role" attribute)

20
	bugfix: Chance works again

19
	enhancement: new operation
		- sl_isinslot - is the specified actor in the specified slot of a SexLab scene (I accidentally implemented this and kept it)
			["sl_isinslot", "$self", "1"]
				$$ == "1" if true; "0" otherwise
	enhancement: new trigger criteria: is_position (is the actor in the indicated slot; what I was asked for)
	enhancement: setting events back to "Select an Event" clears out the event, helping keep your settings.json cleaner
	bugfix: Main no longer skipping most of the checks due to my switch to int conversion and not paying attention to !
	bugfix: SexLab event handling no longer goes into an infinite loop (present since v16)
	change: brought in "whatsnew" to consolidate change history

18
	enhancement: new operations
		- sl_advance
			["sl_advance"] (go forward) OR ["sl_advance", "-1"] (go backward)
		- actor_isaffectedby
			["actor_isaffectedby", "Skyrim.esm:1030541"] (actor is affected by FortifyHealthFFSelf (i.e. Potion of Health), $$ == "1")

17
	enhancement: removed SexLab hard dependency; you can now enjoy your sl(shhh)_triggers on your more vanilla Skyrim experiences
		existing functions should gracefully degrade or give best accurate answer (i.e. gender coming from base actor instead of sexlab if not available)
	enhancement: MCM Main page now displays SexLab status
	bugfix: fixed a bug in the MCM trigger cleanup code

16
	enhancement: added keymapping as an event; you can now bind keymappings to, as usual, up to 3 command files
		also allows for modifier use
		also allows for Dynamic Activation Key use per trigger
	enhancement: events will only be registered for if triggers exist that use them; if you do not hook any SexLab events, they will not be registered
		registration will update if you update the MCM
	change: lots of refactoring, technically some performance improvements but I haven't done timings so it's mostly my instinct, some general code cleanup (mostly due to mess of my own making)
	change: event id values (0 for SLStart...) are now 1 higher (1 for SLStart) to make the MCM behave more nicely; this should get converted automatically
	change: started adding some non-trigger values into settings.json, currently to track version; this is to help allow for settings updates in the future
	

15
	enhancement: improved "top of the hour" updategametime processing
	enhancement: variables can be any "$<non-negative-int>"
		["set", "$42", "life, the universe, and everything"]
		is now valid
	enhancement: global variables can be any "$g<non-negative-int>"
		["set", "$g42", "life, the universe, and everything"]
		is now valid
	fixed bug: fixed race condition when running multiple commands from one trigger
	change: renamed operation "actual_hours_since_last_top" to "toh_elapsed_time"
		"actual_hours_since_last_top" redirects to the new functionality for now
	

14
	split "if_race" into "if_race" and "if_player"
		you will likely need to update any triggers that relied on "if_race" previously
		existing "if_race" values will not be automatically updated and you will probably see:
			if you had...			then you will now have until you edit it...
			Player					Undead
			Not Player				Partner Humanoid
			Undead					Partner Creature
			Partner Humanoid		Partner Undead
			Partner Creature		??
			Partner Player			.. crabs??
			Partner Not Player		.. the void of space??
			Partner Undead			Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
