; now arrange for your random selection
; if you want an even distribution, just include one instance of each affix you want in your pool, e.g.:
; set $selectedAffix resultfrom rnd_list $compacting $diminishing $expansion $magnification $boob $butt $hips $thighs $nippleIncrease $nippleReduce $arms $waist $belly $curves $flattening
; and of course you would not comment out any of the original affix definitions
;
; but perhaps you want to change up the weighting, exclude a few things, you might do this:
set $selectedAffix resultfrom rnd_list $curves $flattening $expansion $compacting $magnification $diminishing $boob $butt $butt $hips $hips $hips $thighs $thighs $thighs $thighs

set $desiredElixir $"TFE{selectedAffix}Potion"

; variants include
; TFE<affix>Potion
; TFE<stat>StealthPotion<affix> 
;	where <stat> is one of: Health, Magicka, Stamina
; So for each of the 15 affixex you have 4 variants; so 60 total if you wanted all of them in a pool
; Plus the TFEResetPotion
